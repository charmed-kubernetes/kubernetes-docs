Charmed Kubernetes officially supports the most recent three (3) minor releases
of Kubernetes.

Current Release: **{{ release }}**

Supported releases: **{{ supported_releases_x }}**

## Charmed Kubernetes bundle versions

**Charmhub.io** hosts the **Charmed Kubernetes** bundles as well as
individual charms. To deploy the latest, stable bundle, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes
```

It is also possible to deploy a specific version of the bundle by including
the `--channel` argument. For example, to deploy the **Charmed Kubernetes**
bundle for the Kubernetes {{ release_n1 }} release, you could run:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes --channel={{ release_n1 }}
```

It is still possible to deploy older, unsupported versions of Charmed Kubernetes.
Older bundle files are available for download in the [releases][] directory of
the Charmed Kubernetes repository. These can be downloaded and deployed with
Juju as with any local bundle file.

Only the latest three versions of Charmed Kubernetes are supported at any time.
  </p>

## Finding version info

To check which versions of Kubernetes are available, use the `snap info` command:

```bash
snap info kube-apiserver
```

Keep in mind that although snap info enumerates all available versions, only
the latest three stable versions are officially supported:

```no-highlight
{{ snap_info_kubeapiserver }}
```

In the above output, the stable release is identified as {{ release }}, and so {{ release_n1 }} and
{{ release_n2 }} are also currently supported.
