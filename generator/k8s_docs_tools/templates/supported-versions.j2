Charmed Kubernetes officially supports the three (3) most recent minor releases
of Kubernetes.

Current release: **{{ release }}**

Supported releases: **{{ supported_releases_x }}**

## Charmed Kubernetes bundle versions

**Charmhub.io** hosts Charmed Kubernetes bundles as well as
individual charms. To deploy the latest stable bundle, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes
```

It is also possible to deploy a specific version of the bundle by including
the `--channel` argument. For example, to deploy the Charmed Kubernetes
bundle for the Kubernetes {{ release_n1 }} release, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes --channel={{ release_n1 }}/stable
```

It is still possible to deploy older, unsupported versions of Charmed Kubernetes.
Older bundle files are available for download in the [releases][] directory of
the Charmed Kubernetes bundle repository. These can be downloaded and deployed with
Juju as with any local bundle file.
