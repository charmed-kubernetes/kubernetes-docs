Charmed Kubernetes officially supports the most recent three (3) minor releases
of Kubernetes.

Current Release: **{{ release }}**

Supported releases: **{{ supported_releases_x }}**

## Charmed Kubernetes bundle versions

**Charmhub.io** hosts the **Charmed Kubernetes** bundles as well as
individual charms. To deploy the latest, stable bundle, run the command:

```bash
juju deploy charmed-kubernetes
```

It is also possible to deploy a specific version of the bundle by including the
revision number. For example, to deploy the **Charmed Kubernetes** bundle for the Kubernetes 1.23
release, you could run:

```bash
juju deploy cs:charmed-kubernetes-862
```

The revision numbers for bundles are generated automatically when the bundle is
updated, including for testing and beta versions, so it isn't always the case
that a higher revision number is 'better'. The revision numbers for the release
versions of the **Charmed Kubernetes** bundle are shown in the table below:

Only the latest three versions of Charmed Kubernetes are supported at any time.
  </p>

## Finding version info

To check which versions of Kubernetes are available, use the `snap info` command:

```bash
snap info kube-apiserver
```

Keep in mind that although snap info enumerates all available versions, only
the latest three stable versions are officially supported:

```no-highlight
{{ snap_info_kubeapiserver }}
```

In the above output, the stable release is identified as {{ release }}, and so {{ release_n1 }} and
{{ release_n2 }} are also currently supported.
