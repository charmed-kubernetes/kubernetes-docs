# 1.13 Release Notes

## What's new

- Keystone support

Added support for a relation from Keystone to the `kubernetes-master` charm. When related, Kubernetes 
will use Keystone for authentication and, potentially, authorisation.

- Vault PKI support

Added support for using [Vault](https://jujucharms.com/u/openstack-charmers/vault/) for PKI in place of
EasyRSA. Vault is more secure and robust than EasyRSA and supports more advanced features for certificate
management.

- Encryption-at-rest support using Vault

Added support for encryption-at-rest for cluster secrets, leveraging
[Vault](https://jujucharms.com/u/openstack-charmers/vault/) for data protection. This ensures that even
the keys used to encrypt the data are protected at rest, unlike many configurations of encryption-at-rest
for Kubernetes.

## Known issues

 - any remaining major issues currently being worked on
 - for the next release
