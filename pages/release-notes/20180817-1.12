# 1.12 Release Notes WIP

TODO: Short intro paragraph that details highlights or significant changes, possibly with links

- New kubernetes-worker charm config: kubelet-extra-config

In Kubernetes 1.10, a new KubeletConfiguration file was introduced, and many of
Kubelet's command line options were moved there and marked as deprecated. In
order to accomodate this change, we've introduced a new charm config to
kubernetes-worker: `kubelet-extra-config`.

This config can be used to override KubeletConfiguration values provided by
the charm, and is usable on any Canonical cluster running Kubernetes 1.10+.

The value for this config must be a YAML mapping that can be safely
merged with a KubeletConfiguration file. For example:
```
juju config kubernetes-worker kubelet-extra-config="{evictionHard: {memory.available: 200Mi}}"
```

For more information about KubeletConfiguration, see upstream docs:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-config-file/

- Added support for Dynamic Kubelet Configuration

While we recommend `kubelet-extra-config` as a more robust and approachable way
to configure Kubelet, we've also made it possible to configure kubelet using
the Dynamic Kubelet Configuration feature that comes with Kubernetes 1.11+. You
can read about that here:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reconfigure-kubelet/
