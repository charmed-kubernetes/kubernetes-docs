[Keepalived](http://www.keepalived.org/) is software which provides high
availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring
those nodes, failing over when one goes down.

## Usage

The Keepalived charm is a
[subordinate](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/authors-subordinate-applications).

### Using with Kubernetes ([Charmed Kubernetes](https://jujucharms.com/canonical-kubernetes))

Use keepalived with Charmed Kubernetes to ensure kubeapi-load-balancer is not a single
point of failure.

```
# These instructions assume you've deployed Charmed Kubernetes already:
# juju deploy charmed-kubernetes

# deploy the keepalived charm
juju deploy keepalived

# add new keepalived relations
juju relate keepalived:juju-info kubeapi-load-balancer:juju-info
juju relate keepalived:lb-sink kubeapi-load-balancer:website
juju relate keepalived:loadbalancer kubernetes-master:loadbalancer
juju relate keepalived:website kubernetes-worker:kube-api-endpoint

# remove Charmed Kubernetes relations that are no longer needed
juju remove-relation kubernetes-worker:kube-api-endpoint kubeapi-load-balancer:website
juju remove-relation kubernetes-master:loadbalancer kubeapi-load-balancer:loadbalancer


# NOTE: ensure this relation from Charmed Kubernetes is preserved, so that the
# load-balancer knows about backend endpoints
juju relate kubernetes-master:kube-api-endpoint kubeapi-load-balancer:apiserver || true

# configure keepalived (values are examples, substitute your own)
export VIP_HOSTNAME=test.example.com
juju config keepalived virtual_ip=10.10.74.250
juju config keepalived port=443
juju config keepalived vip_hostname=$VIP_HOSTNAME

# set extra_sans to update api server ssl cert
juju config kubeapi-load-balancer extra_sans=$VIP_HOSTNAME
juju config kubernetes-master extra_sans=$VIP_HOSTNAME

# if you only have one kubeapi-load-balancer unit, add another one
juju add-unit kubeapi-load-balancer

```
This changes kubelet and kubectl to use the VIP to reach the Kubernetes API server.

### Using with HA Proxy
```
juju deploy keepalived
juju add-relation haproxy keepalived

```

| name | type   | Default      | Description                               |
|------|--------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| <a id="table-healthcheck_interval"> </a> healthcheck_interval | int | 2 | vrrp_script-based health-check interval, in seconds  |
| <a id="table-network_interface"> </a> network_interface | string |  | Network interface name for the VIP. The default value is the result of running the following command: `route | grep default | head -n 1 | awk {'print $8'}`.  |
| <a id="table-port"> </a> port | int | 443 | A port to pass to clients.  |
| <a id="table-router_id"> </a> router_id | int | 23 | Virtual router identifier - a number between 1 and 255 that's unique within the network segment  |
| <a id="table-vip_hostname"> </a> vip_hostname | string |  | A VIP hostname to pass to clients.  |
| <a id="table-virtual_ip"> </a> virtual_ip | string |  | Virtual IP/netmask that will be moved between instances, e.g.: 10.1.2.3/16  |
