# 1.28

### August 16, 2023 - `charmed-kubernetes --channel 1.28/stable`

The release bundle can also be [downloaded here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charmed-kubernetes/bundle/main/releases/1.28/bundle.yaml).

## What's new

### Broader adoption of ops charming

We're pleased to announce a number charms have been refactored from the `reactive` and `pod-spec` styles to `ops` style.  These uplifts were taken in an effort to have access to charm libraries, better support from juju, and better community support when demonstrating charming.  Some of the uplifted charms include:

* calico
* metallb

And coming soon are a more charms like
* kubeapi-load-balancer
* kubernetes-worker
* kubernetes-control-plane

### Ceph CSI adds CephFS

Providing much needed feature parity to the aging cdk-addons, the ceph-csi charm now supports operations of ceph-fs along with the already supported ceph-rdb.
