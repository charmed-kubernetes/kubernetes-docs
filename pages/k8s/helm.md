# Add a Helm Chart

Now you have a cluster up and running with [storage][storage], you can install
applications in your cluster with [**Helm**][helm-home]. This handles the install
and **Kubernetes** configuration for a wide range of applications using
'charts'.  We'll take you through the steps:

## Install Helm

**Helm** is available as a snap, so installing is as simple as:

```bash
sudo snap install helm
```

**Helm** needs to install a component on the cluster also (the `Tiller`). It
gets the information on your cluster from `kubectl`, so if you have more than
one cluster, make sure you are switched to the correct _context_.

To install the 'Tiller', run:

```bash
helm init
```

## Chose a Chart

**Helm**'s application packages are called charts. You can fetch the latest
list of charts with:

```bash
 helm repo update
 ```

To see which repositories you are connected to:

```bash
helm repo list
```
...which by default should list:

```
NAME  	URL                                             
stable	https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
local 	http://127.0.0.1:8879/charts                    
```

You can search these repositories for suitable charts. For example:

```bash
 helm search jenkins
```

would return:

```no-highlight
NAME          	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                       
stable/jenkins	0.19.1       	2.121.3    	Open source continuous integration server. It s...
```

## Deploying

Once you have selected the chart, you can install it with **Helm**.

```bash
helm install stable/jenkins
```

Pay particular attention to the output. many **Helm** charts, including this one for
[**Jenkins**][jenkins] include important information about how to connect or use the
newly installed pod.  In this case, you should see something similar to:

```no-highlight
NOTES:
1. Get your 'admin' user password by running:
  <pre>
  printf $(kubectl get secret --namespace default hipster-orangutan-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
  </pre>
2. Get the Jenkins URL to visit by running these commands in the same shell:
  NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
        You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get svc --namespace default -w hipster-orangutan-jenkins'
  <pre>
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default hipster-orangutan-jenkins --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:8080/login
  </pre>

3. Login with the password from step 1 and the username: admin
```

As mentioned in the above notes, the jenkins chart uses a loadbalancer which requires a
public IP address. Allocating IP addresses is done through the underlying cloud, so the
process could take anywhere from no time at all to a couple of minutes.

You can confirm that a new pod has been created with:

```bash
helm list
```

... which should return a list of all the **Helm** charts which have been installed

```no-highlight
NAME                        REVISION     	UPDATED                                  	STATUS  	        CHART               NAMESPACE
hipster-orangutan	1       	              Thu Nov  8 14:41:33 2018   	DEPLOYED    	jenkins-0.19.1	default  
```

## Accessing

Following the notes displayed when we installed the chart, we can first obtain the
password:

```bash
  printf $(kubectl get secret --namespace default hipster-orangutan-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
  ```

Which returns a value like `4oEUJeMvpu`. This is the password for the admin user. Now
we just need the IP address.

To check whether this has been assigned yet, run:

```bash
kubectl get svc --namespace default hipster-orangutan-jenkins
```

If the _External_IP_ is still shown as pending, you will have to try back later. If a value is
listed there, run the commands from the previous output to get the full URL.

```bash
export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default hipster-orangutan-jenkins --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}")
echo http://$SERVICE_IP:8080/login
```


![jenkins login page][img-jenkins]

Enter 'admin' as the user name, and the password we retrieved earlier...

![jenkins login page][img-jenkins2]

Congratulations - you have now deployed **Jenkins** with **Helm**
