## 1.26

### December ??, 2022 - `charmed-kubernetes --channel 1.26/stable` 

The release bundle can also be [downloaded here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charmed-kubernetes/bundle/main/releases/1.26/bundle.yaml).

## What's new

- Ubuntu 22.04 default series

Ubuntu 22.04 is now the default series for new deployments of Charmed
Kubernetes.

Ubuntu 20.04 remains fully supported, but is no longer the default series.

Ubuntu 18.04 is no longer supported. For existing clusters still running Ubuntu
18.04, it is recommended to perform a series upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 before
upgrading to Charmed Kubernetes 1.26.

- Kube-OVN BGP support

The Kube-OVN charm's new `bgp-speakers` config option makes it possible to peer
Kubernetes nodes with external BGP routers and exchange routing information for
Kube-OVN subnets. This makes it possible to access pod IPs directly from
external networks.

- Kube-OVN traffic mirroring

The new `enable-global-mirror` and `mirror-iface` config options make it
possible to configure traffic mirroring for Kube-OVN. When configured, Kube-OVN
will mirror pod network traffic to a network interface on each Kubernetes node,
making it easier to observe pod network traffic with tools such as tcpdump.

- MetalLB enhancements

The metallb-controller and metallb-speaker charms have been upgraded to
v0.12 and can now run on amd64, arm, arm64, ppc64le, and s390x hosts.
