---

Installing the Charmed Distribution of Kubernetes<sup>&reg;</sup> (CDK)
on a single machine is possible for the purposes of testing and development.

Be aware that the full deployment of CDK has system requirements which may exceed a standard laptop or desktop machine. It is only recommended for a machine with 32GB RAM and 250GB of SSD storage.

<div class="p-notification--positive"><p markdown="1" class="p-notification__response">
<span class="p-notification__status">Note:</span>
If you don't meet these requirements or want a lightweight way to develop on pure Kubernetes, we recommend  <a href="https://microk8s.io/">microk8s</a>
</p></div>

The main requirement for a local install is a local cloud to run CDK on. This is achieved by using lightweight containers managed by [LXD][lxd-home]. LXD version 3.0 or better is required for the default installer, and there are some specific profile requirements as detailed below.

## If LXD is already installed

The **conjure-up** installer requires a specific LXD version, profile and storage options which may conflict with any existing version of LXD.
To avoid problems, migrate from the _deb_ LXD packaging after installing the snap version:

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
/snap/bin/lxd.migrate
```

This will move all container specific data to the snap version and clean up the unused Debian packages. You should also check out the [notes for using LXD with conjure-up][conjure-lxd].

You can now proceed using the main installer. Follow the [install instructions][quickstart] and choose `localhost` in the `CHOOSE A CLOUD` step.

## Ubuntu Server

### 1. Install LXD

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
```

### 2. Run the LXD init script

```bash
/snap/bin/lxd init
```

### 3. Configure the installer

The init script itself can vary depending on the version of LXD. The important configuration options for the installer are:

- Networking: Do **NOT** enable ipv6 networking on the bridge interface
- Storage Pool: Use the 'dir' storage type

You can now proceed using the main installer. Follow the [install instructions][quickstart] and choose `localhost` in the `CHOOSE A CLOUD` step.

## Ubuntu Desktop

### 1. Install LXD

```bash
sudo snap install lxd
```

### 2. Create users

In order to access the LXD service your user will need to be apart of the `lxd` group. Run the following:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G lxd $USER
newgrp lxd
```

### 3. Run the LXD init script

```bash
/snap/bin/lxd init
```

### 4. Configure

The init script itself can vary depending on the version of LXD. The important configuration options for the installer are:

- Networking: Do **NOT** enable ipv6 networking on the bridge interface
- Storage Pool: Use the 'dir' storage type

You can now proceed using the main installer. Follow the [install instructions][quickstart] and choose `localhost` in the `CHOOSE A CLOUD` step.

## Other platforms (ArchLinux, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE )

1.  Install LXD using the [instructions for your OS][lxd-install]
2.  Install Conjure up using the [instructions for your OS][conjure-up-install]
3.  Proceed with the relevant steps from the [install instructions][quickstart] and choose `localhost` in the `CHOOSE A CLOUD` step.
