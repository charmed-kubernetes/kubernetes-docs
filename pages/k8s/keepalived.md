The standard deployment of **Charmed Kubernetes** includes a single instance
of the kube-api-loadbalancer. For many use cases this is perfectly adequate,
but in a production environment you should be keen to eliminate any single
point of failure.

The recommended way to provide a failover for the kube-api-loadbalancer is by
using [keepalived][keepalived-home]. This is available as a **Juju** charm and
can be deployed into your **Charmed Kubernetes** model and configured as
follows:

1. Deploy the `keepalived` charm:
    ```bash
    juju deploy cs:~containers/keepalived
    ```

1. Add the required relations :   
    ```bash
    juju add-relation keepalived:juju-info kubeapi-load-balancer:juju-info
    juju add-relation keepalived:lb-sink kubeapi-load-balancer:website
    juju add-relation keepalived:loadbalancer kubernetes-master:loadbalancer
    juju add-relation keepalived:website kubernetes-worker:kube-api-endpoint
    ```
    This redirects both the Kubernetes master and worker units to point at the keepalived
    service rather than the api-endpoint directly.

1. Configure the keepalived application. You should substitute a suitable IP address and
     FQDN in the example below:
    ```bash
    export VIP_HOSTNAME=test.example.com
    juju config keepalived virtual_ip=10.10.74.250
    juju config keepalived port=443
    juju config keepalived vip_hostname=$VIP_HOSTNAME
    ```

1.  Add the new hostname to the API server certificate. This is done by specifying an
    additional [SAN][]:
    ```bash
    juju config kubeapi-load-balancer extra_sans=$VIP_HOSTNAME
    juju config kubernetes-master extra_sans=$VIP_HOSTNAME
    ```

1. Wait for the new service to settle. You can check the status of the `keepalived`
    application by running:
    ```bash
    juju status keepalived
    ```
    Once the application reports a 'ready' status, continue to the next step.

1. Remove unneeded relations:
    ```bash
    juju remove-relation kubernetes-worker:kube-api-endpoint kubeapi-load-balancer:website
    juju remove-relation kubernetes-master:loadbalancer kubeapi-load-balancer:loadbalancer
    ```

1. Scale up the `kubeapi-load-balancer`. You can specify as many units as your situation requires.
    In this example, we add two additional units for a total of three:
    ```bash
    juju add-unit kubeapi-load-balancer -n 2
    ```

Note that the `keepalived` application is a
[_subordinate charm_][subordinate-charm] - it does not require a machine of its
own to run on, but rather runs alongside the `kubeapi-load-balancer` charm. If
for any reason you need to [view logs][logging-doc] or troubleshoot this
application, it will be found co-located on the machines running the load
balancer.
