<p>Deliver ‘Containers as a Service’ across the enterprise with
<strong>Charmed Kubernetes<sup>®</sup></strong> , enabling each
project to spin up a standardised K8s of arbitrary scale, on demand, with centralised
operational control. <strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> provides a well integrated, turn-key
<strong>Kubernetes<sup>®</sup></strong> platform that is open, extensible, and secure.</p>

<p>For more information on the features and benefits of <strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong>, including details on the
<a href="/kubernetes/managed">Managed Kubernetes</a> service, please see the <a href="/kubernetes">Kubernetes section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<p><strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> is built around a number of applications, bundled together and deployed using
<a href="https://jujucharms.com"><strong>Juju</strong></a>, the open source modelling tool for deploying and operating software in
the cloud.</p>

<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>

<p><strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> comes with a powerful volume plugin system that enables many different types
of storage systems to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatically create storage when required.</li>
  <li>Make storage available to containers wherever they’re scheduled.</li>
  <li>Automatically delete the storage when no longer needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong> uses Container Network Interface (CNI) as an interface between
network providers and <strong>Kubernetes</strong> networking. <strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> comes pre-packaged with
several tested CNI plugins like Calico and Flannel.</p>

<h3 id="logging-and-monitoring">Logging and monitoring</h3>

<p>Operations in large-scale distributed clusters require a new level of operational
monitoring and observability. Canonical delivers a standardised set of open source log
aggregation and systems monitoring dashboards with every cloud, using
<strong>Prometheus</strong>, the <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> and <strong>Kibana</strong> stack (ELK), and <strong>Nagios</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-integration">Cloud integration</h3>

<p>Depending on your choice of cloud, <strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> will also install an integration application.
This enables <strong>Charmed Kubernetes</strong> to seamlessly access cloud resources and components without
additional configuration or hassle.</p>
